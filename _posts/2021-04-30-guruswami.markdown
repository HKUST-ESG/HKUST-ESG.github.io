## Abstract
In this talk, we will gently introduce error-correction schemes to
recover from a bounded number of bit flips (that occur at unknown
locations of an n-bit string). We will start with simple, concrete
schemes to correct one or two bit flips, and use that as a springboard
to give a glimpse of algebraic codes called BCH codes, and in the
process hint at why finite fields are useful and cool. Time
permitting, we will talk about how the seemingly distant world of
graph theory can yield efficient codes when the number of bit flips
scales in proportion to n, giving a taste of the power of expansion in
graphs.


## Speaker Bio

Venkatesan Guruswami received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras in 1997, and his PhD in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. From 2002 to 2009, he was a faculty member at the University of Washington. He was a Miller Research Fellow at UC Berkeley from 2001 to 2002, and was a member in the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study from 2007 to 2008.

His research interests span several topics in theoretical computer science, such as the theory of error-correcting codes, approximability of fundamental optimization problems, explicit combinatorial constructions and pseudorandomness, probabilistically checkable proofs, computational complexity theory, and algebraic algorithms. He currently serves on the editorial boards of the SIAM Journal on Computing, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, and the ACM Transactions on Computation Theory, and was program committee chair for the 2012 Computational Complexity conference. He was an invited speaker at the 2010 International Congress of Mathematicians. He is a recipient of the Presburger Award (2012), Packard Fellowship (2005), Sloan Fellowship (2005), NSF CAREER award (2004), ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award (2002), and IEEE Information Theory Society Paper Award (2000).
