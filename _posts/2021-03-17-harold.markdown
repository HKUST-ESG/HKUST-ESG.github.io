## Speaker Bio

Hilary Finucane is co-director of the Program in Medical and Population Genetics. Her research group develops and applies new statistical and computational methods for analyzing biological data. The group’s main focus is on integrating genetic data about disease with molecular data about cell types and biological processes to learn about the causes of disease.

Finucane earned her Ph.D. in applied math from the Department of Mathematics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, supported by a Hertz Foundation Fellowship. Her research was in statistical genetics, advised by Alkes Price at the Harvard School of Public Health. Finucane also holds a M.Sc. in theoretical computer science from the Weizmann Institute of Science and a B.A. in math from Harvard. She is a recipient of the National Institutes of Health Director’s Early Independence Award.
